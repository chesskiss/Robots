# simple_robots
The repo name might be misleading. Using Robo-physics interface, Python or other languages and tools you can build quite complex robots...
But with the help of the right tools, your project can be concluded witha few **simple** lines of code.

Here you'll find a few examples for that.
Enjoy :)
