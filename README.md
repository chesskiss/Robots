# Robotics
From easy peasy projects to yearly ones, here you may find a lot of usefull code for your next robot. 

Projects were built using :
1. Tello-Edu package - for programming drones
2. Robo-physics interface - extremly user friendly and easy to use. With a few lines of code you could build quite complicated robots that use AI and much more...

Most commonly used langauge for my projects was Python.

Enjoy :)
