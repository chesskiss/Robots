# Robotics
From easy peasy projects to yearly ones, here you may find a lot of useful code for your next robot. 

Projects were built using :
1. Tello-Edu package - for programming drones
2. Robo-physics interface - extremely user-friendly and easy to use. With a few lines of code, you could build quite complicated robots that use AI and much more...

The most commonly used language for my projects was Python.

You can ping me at arnold.cheskis@gmail.com for more info and instructions on rerunning it. I do not guarantee I will remember everything, but I will help u find the answers :)

Enjoy :)
